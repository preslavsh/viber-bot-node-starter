Hi guys, where is a good place to report platform bugs (not in the SDKs)?
For example a component that works on mobile, but breaks on desktop
i.e. something more collaborative than email
Hey guys why is there no "issues" tab on repo?

Hi ! I want to know the Viberbot can join the public group chat?
Hello! I'm quite new to Viber's API so maybe my question is little bit naive. Is it possible to somehow "add" bot to group chat to cater that chat users need?
